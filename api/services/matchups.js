// Get matchups for new round
// ({ playerId: record }, teams?) => [ [ player/[team], player/[team] ], ...  ] (match table)


// TO CHANGE:
//   - Change reporting to report match records (ie 2-0, 2-1, etc)
//   - Team from player array = grouping by size
//   - Allow swaping teams (re-order draft.players)
